# Mission_to_Mars
The purpose of the challenge is to improve a web app that would provide the latest news and updates on the Mission to Mars, including images of the planet's hemisphere. For this task, I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to
*  scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, 
*  store the scraped data on a Mongo database, 
*  use a web application to display the data,
*  modify the web app's design so that these images can be displayed.
