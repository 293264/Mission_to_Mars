## Overview of Challenge ##
The current version of Robin's web app is functional and looks good, but she needs to polish it. The request is to modify the existing web app to incorporate all four hemispheres of Mars. Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, I used the images of Mars' hemispheres to generate the data for Robin, stored the data in a MongoDB database, built a web app that displays the data, and adapted the web app to display the images.

To complete the assignment, I had to execute the following 


  1.	Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles. 
   
  Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter I scraped full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.


  2.	Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles.
  
  Using your Python and HTML skills, I added the code I created in Deliverable 1 to my scraping.py file, updated Mongo database,  and modify my index.html file so that the webpage contains all the information I collected as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.

  3.	Add Bootstrap 3 Components.
  
  For this part of the Challenge, update the web app to make it mobile-responsive, and add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.
